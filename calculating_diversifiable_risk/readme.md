# Calculating Diversifiable and non Diversifiable Risk

## Systematic (Un-diversifiable) vs Idiosyncratic(diversifiable) risk

### Undiversifiable
This component depends on the variance of each idividual security. It is also known as systematic risk.

Cannot be diversified.
* Recession of the economy
* Low consumer spending
* Wars
* Forces of nature

### Diversifiable
Idiosyncratic risk (also known as company specific risk). Driven by company-specific events.

Diversifiable risk can be eliminated if we invest in non-correlated assets.

* Automotive
* Construction
* Energy
* Technology

## Strategy
Indexes such as the S&P 500 mitigate portfolio risk by spreading investments over different industries thereby diversifying the risk of the portfolio.
