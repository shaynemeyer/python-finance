# Monte Carlo applied in a Corporate Finance context
## Finance managers face many unknowns
* must forecast revenues
* costs of goods sold
* operating expenses

## Revenues

Current Revenues = Last Year Revenues * (1 + y-o-y growth rate)

By running simulations, finance managers can understand the direction where revenues are heading.

* Revenue growth rate - obtained using Historical Data or User Intuition
* Revenue volatility - obtained using Historical Data or User Intuition


### Cogs - Cost of goods sold
Modeled as a percentage of revenues

### Opex - Operating expenses
Modeled as a percentage of revenues

We need to model Cogs and Opex as a percentage of revenues, then model the development of the percentage of revenues.

If revenues are low, there will be no need to spend a lot for Cogs as fewer products will be produced.

Revenues - Cogs = ***Gross Profit***

Gross Profit - Opex = ***Operating Profit***
